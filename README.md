# Thesis
R Code from my Master Thesis written together with Maximilian Beck 
The code has comments throughout and should be understandable. You will need the MOP and MiD datasets to run the code.
Each survey consists of of several datasets.
To run the code, it is necessary to have access to the MiD and MOP datasets. 
The datasets are not publicly available. 
To request access to the datasets please get in touch with the Clearingstelle Verkehr under this link: https://daten.clearingstelle-verkehr.de/279/
